A [Django App](https://www.djangoproject.com/) connected with a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.<br/>
You add data through models from the Django admin page(default).<br/>
Has a page to display the data of a specific table of the database and a [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) page which is still in the making.<br/>
To use put your database info in the settings.py folder and go to the link http://127.0.0.1:8000/dbview/<br/>
